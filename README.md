this is a copy of the Arduino folder on my old iMac g4 800mHz
that I used as my arduino programming computer in my workshop.

right now it is a copy from May 3rd, 2014.

These are programs from various past projects and robots.

many of these programs are unfinished, but have a finished version.
I was bit crazy with copying files before I learned about version 
control.

yeah..
